# Binary Search Visualizer

This is a web application designed to visually demonstrate the **binary search algorithm**. Users can interactively add numbers to a sorted array and then search for a specific value. The application animates the search process, providing a clear, step-by-step visualization of how the algorithm works.

## Features

* **Interactive Array**: Dynamically add numbers to a list which is automatically kept sorted.
* **Animated Search**: Watch the binary search algorithm in action as it narrows down the search space.
* **Visual Feedback**:

  * Elements outside the current search range are visually faded out.
  * The found element is highlighted in green with a pulse animation.
  * If the element is not found, all elements turn red to indicate a failed search.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, modern design built with Tailwind CSS for an intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **React.js**: For building the interactive user interface.
* **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
* **JavaScript**: The core logic for handling state and running the search algorithm.
